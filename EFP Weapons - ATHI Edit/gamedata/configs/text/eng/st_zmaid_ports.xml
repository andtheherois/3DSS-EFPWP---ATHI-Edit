Standard finish is Parkerizing, and the gun is provided with replacement pistol grip, which allows easy conversion to 'Cruiser' modification. Since 1987, this was the standard shotgun of US Armed forces; officially replaced in US Army with Benelli M1014 semi-automatic shotgun, Mossberg 590A1 shotguns are still used by US Navy and US Marine Corp.\n \n

This new rifle was intended to replace the ageing MAS Mle.49/56 semi-automatic rifles, MAT-49 submachine guns and MAC Mle.1929 light machine guns. The first FAMAS prototype had been built in 1971, and French military began to test this rifle in 1972. Meanwhile, France adopted a Swiss-designed SIG SG-540 5.56mm assault rifle as an intermediate solution. The FAMAS was adopted by the French in 1978 and since then became a standard French Army rifle, known among the French soldiers as "Le Clairon" (the bulge).\n \n

		<text>The UMP was developed by H&amp;K in the 1990s, first appearing on the market in 1999. The idea behind the UMP was to create lightweight and powerful submachine gun, that was also cheaper than the MP5. The UMP, being targeted primarily for US law enforcement, appeared in .45ACP and .40SW chamberings, and later in 9mm. Providing greater stopping power than the MP5, the UMP45 also produces more recoil. This makes controlling full automatic fire more difficult. The UMP45's cyclic rate of fire was lowered significantly to combat this problem.\n \n
