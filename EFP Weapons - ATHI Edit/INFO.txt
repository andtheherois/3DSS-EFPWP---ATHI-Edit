=== EFPWP ===

Porting process and extra implementations have been done by Maid and Haruka from EFP server.

We used assets from:

• MP5 and FAMAS by FX0X01 original mods found in Fallout 4
	https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/36471565
• G3 by Subleader100 original mod found in Fallout 4
	https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/38602415?tab=user+files
• ACE 21, BRN-180, STV-380 and Type 90 by Akinaro

• Escape from Tarkov (Rest of the ported guns)

This project wouldn't be possible without their amazing assets.
As well as the huge help from Qatapro, Firebreath and LVutner.

This current version is a functional WIP, there's a couple more guns yet to be covered
and some new features to add.

Last but not least, thanks to the EFP community, this is done for free for the community to enjoy.
